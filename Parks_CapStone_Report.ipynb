    "\n",
    "Givvin that a bike rental will do very well near parks which is abundent in the city and a single store location can serve multple parks he would like to know how many clouseters of parks are there in NYC<br>\n",

    "### Choosing the correct number of clusters. <br>\n",

    "A backgrounder on Silhouette analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We can use Silhouette analysis to evaluate each model. A Silhouette coefficient is calculated for observation, which is then averaged to determine the Silhouette score. <br>\n",
    "The coefficient combines the average within-cluster distance with average nearest-cluster distance to assign a value between -1 and 1. A value below zero  <br>denotes that the observation is probably in the wrong cluster and a value closer to 1 denotes that the observation is a great fit for the cluster and  <br>clearly separated from other clusters. This coefficient essentially measures how close an observation is to neighboring clusters, where it is desirable <br> to be the maximum distance possible from neighboring clusters. <br>\n",
    "We can automatically determine the best number of clusters, k, by selecting the model which yields the highest Silhouette score.” <br>\n",
